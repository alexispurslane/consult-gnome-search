#+title: Gnome Search Provider Emacs Integration

Search is a central element of the Gnome desktop environment.  Many
applications implement the [[https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/search-provider.html][Search Provider]] =dbus= interface to
provide suitable results.

The aim of this package is to make these search results also available
within the Emacs editor.

* Configuration

The dbus-method =ActivateResult= is used to open the selected result in the application implementing the [[https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/search-provider.html][Search Provider]].
Nautilus for example leverages [[https://portland.freedesktop.org/doc/xdg-mime.html][xdg-mime]]  to delelegate the activation to the configured application.

You most likely want to set:
#+begin_src bash
xdg-mime default emacsclient.desktop text/plain
xdg-mime default emacsclient.desktop text/x-csrc
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

to edit edit the selected files within Emacs.

* Installation

Available via =package-vc-install= (Emacs 29):

#+begin_src elisp
  (package-vc-install "https://github.com/juergenhoetzel/consult-gnome-search")
#+end_src

I plan to publish the package later on [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]].

#+title: Gnome Search Provider Emacs Integration

Search is a central element of the Gnome desktop environment.  Many
applications implement the [[https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/search-provider.html][Search Provider]] =dbus= interface to
provide suitable results.

The aim of this package is to make these search results also available
within the Emacs editor.
